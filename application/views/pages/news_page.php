    In an interview in ANC with Dr. Oscar Tinio, Comission on Legislation Chair, PH Medical Association, he stated how glad he is, because Hotel Sogo open their doors for them. “ We asked if Hotel Sogo has given us the permission to use their rooms, so that we can house our personnel, because it would be easy for us to keep in touch and be able to report for work. And other hotels are doing the same thing and some of the  hospitals convert some of their floors to dormitories for their personnel so they won’t have to leave the premises any longer.” <br><br>

I’m proud to say that the company foresee and swiftly implemented these safety measures for the welfare of our employees and guests especially the frontliners, OFWs, and seafarer repatriates who are currently staying in our hotel. We wanted them to feel secure and comfortable,” Mr. Malaca said. <br><br>
    
    As part of their “So Clean, So Good, So Safe” campaign under its Sogo So Safe Program, Hotel Sogo showcases its new normal policies via its New Normal Playbook that were sent to different agencies like the Department of Health (DOH), Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA), and the Department of Tourism (DOT).  <br><br>
    
    “I would like to acknowledge the support and assistance of the DOH, OWWA, and DOT to make our new normal be fully recognized and to be implemented in our hotels. We are grateful that they have trusted us to be their partner of choice in taking care of the OFWs and frontliners in this time of crisis. Indeed, we are one with the government to create a better life with this new normal,” Mr. Malaca added. <br>
    To highlight their new normal, Hotel Sogo adapted the use of Ultraviolet (UV) light, which are modified in cash registers, keycard cases, elevator buttons, and its ceiling, room door handles, as well as in food preparation for an enhanced cleaning and disinfection processes. UVC light will be also used to disinfect the room from bedsheets, cabinets, mirrors, tables, and chairs, and even in bathrooms. <br><br>
    According to studies, the use of UVC lights is highly effective at disinfection as it kills bacteria, germs, and viruses. These UVCs are also less harmful to human skin since they are particularly installed in features like door handles, which are not handled for a long time. <br><br>
    
    Contactless doors and elevator buttons through the use of key chains, and automatic faucets and urinals will also be part of the new norm to avoid the spread of the virus in commonly touched areas. <br><br>
    
    Safety measures such as temperature screening, placement of sanitizers in common areas, and social distancing will still be implemented. Employees are required to wear PPE uniforms, face masks, face shields, gloves, and boots when cleaning. And also, guests are also required to wear a face mask upon entering the hotel. <br><br>
    
    Various medical professionals and LGUs commended Hotel Sogo as they are the first to implement these innovative safety measures in response to the House Bill 6623 “New Normal for the Workplace and Public Spaces Act”. <br><br>

Just like the Bible verse “And whatever you ask in prayer, you will receive, if you have faith” from Matthew 21:22, blessings pour down on Fr. Teofilo S. Rustia’s life.<br><br>

    Fr. Teo - as called by his friends, founder of the Religious Society of Our Lady of Bethesda, had received a tumultuous amount of 2.4 million for the development to the Oratorio de los Peregrinos.<br><br>
    
    In a joint discussion made last 2018, Fr. Teo together with Mr. Edmundo Las, a devout catholic and Global Comfort Group Corporation’s (GCGC) Board of Director had a dialog in making <br><br>
    
    
    
    improvements to the oratorio. Church repairs and future developments were greatly considered by Mr. Las especially the home lift elevator which he donated amounting to PHP 1,170,000 million. Mr. Mr. Edmundo thinks that the renovation of the elevator will greatly benefit the priests and elderly pilgrims of Oratorio de Los Peregrinos.<br><br>
    “We started building 3 years ago; we built this on my property and I offered it to the community so this could be a permanent place for the oratorio – our home, our center.” Fr. Rustia said. 
    In addition, Mr. Las also presented Fr. Teo with a grant to finance the other projects of Religious Society of Our Lady of Bethesda, the organization which operates the chapel. <br><br>
    
    “One of our future projects is to expand our orphanage since we only take care of only 12 boys. Of course we would like to invite more to become priests. We took care of them from preparatory to Grade 12 and further guide them to become priests. Another big effort we want to put up is to take care of the retired priests, we have started that already but you have to put another home, so these are all lifted to God.” Fr. Teo added.<br><br>
    
    Blessings did really pour down for oratorio when Fr. Teo and Mr. Las were reunited. And little did we know, they both share the love of God, leadership among others, and care for one another.<br><br>
    
    “Providence – that is our mantra. It means God takes care of everything, puts everything into place. I and Ed first met during one of the get-together with my ex-seminarians. I think it’s God’s will for us to meet there together with my ex-seminarians as we are planning for projects to help the community. And so, that started our journey together as he became honorary alumnus of our seminary and became a frontrunner in putting up the orphanage we built in Sta. 
    
    
    
    
    Maria, Bulacan. Also, through Ed’s inspiration and leadership, he was the moving spirit behind the construction of Tahanan ni Sta. Isabel, the home for elderly women we built after the orphanage.” Fr. Teo shared.<br><br>
    
    “Ed knows what to do and he always fins solution. I believe all the leader of Sogo will help with our advocacy, including the people and companies connected with Sogo. I thank Ed very much for putting the presence of God in Sogo very much. We’re happy because more and more are into this [helping religious organizations] and I am happy that Sogo isn’t new in this effort. God bless our efforts so that in return we may be a blessing for others. The bounty that you get from God’s goodness, you should be able to share and that is what many business enterprises now have come to realized and Sogo is in forefront of the crusade”<br><br>
